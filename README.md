Title: Credit Card Approval Prediction

Project Overview: Credit scorecards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. They use personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a credit card applicant is a 'good' or 'bad' client, aiding banks in their decision-making process.
